        <b style="font-size: 30px;">Facebook shuts down a military-linked environmental misinformation network in Brazil.</b>
        <h5>APR 8, 2022 11:31 AM PHT</h5>
        <div class="img1" style="height:550px;"></div>
        <b>FACEBOOK </b>
        <p>On Thursday, April 7, Facebook owner Meta Platforms said that it had taken down a network of social media accounts linked to the Brazilian military that disguised as bogus charities to downplay the consequences of deforestation.

            Despite the fact that the individuals participating in the network were active military members, Meta's investigation found insufficient evidence to determine whether they were following orders or acting autonomously, according to a source familiar with the situation.
            
            Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro may suffer a setback as a result of Meta's quarterly report. Long a skeptic of environmentalists, the far-right former army captain has sent the armed forces to the Amazon on failed missions to stop the destruction of the world's biggest jungle.</p>
        <p>Bolsonaro's criticisms on giant internet corporations, which he accuses of suffocating conservative viewpoints on their platforms, may be fueled by Meta's first takedown of a network focused solely on environmental problems.

            Bolsonaro and his followers, according to critics, exploit the platforms to promote harmful disinformation that undermines Brazil's democratic institutions.</p>
        <p>"In 2021, they built Pages that pretended to be bogus environmental NGOs and activists in the Amazonas area of Brazil. They wrote about deforestation, saying that not all of it is damaging and condemning respectable environmental NGOs who spoke out against it in the Amazon," according to Meta's study.

            "Our study discovered linkages to persons linked with the Brazilian Military, despite the fact that the people behind (the network) sought to disguise their names and coordination."</p>

        <h5>APR 8, 2022 8:02 AM PHT</h5>

        <p><B>WASHINGTON DC, USA</B> - On Thursday, April 7, the Senate approved Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, marking a watershed moment for the United States and a success for President Joe Biden, who delivered on a campaign pledge to diversify the federal judiciary.

            The vote to confirm the 51-year-old federal appellate judge to a lifetime position on the nation's top judicial body was 53-47, with three Republicans joining Biden's fellow Democrats — Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney. A simple majority was required, since Jackson overcame Republican resistance in a politicized Supreme Court nomination process.</p>
        <p>Three Republicans – Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney – joined Biden's fellow Democrats in voting to confirm the 51-year-old federal appellate judge to a lifetime position on the nation's top judicial body.

            ackson will replace the 83-year-old Breyer on the liberal group of a court with a 6-3 conservative majority that is becoming increasingly forceful. Breyer will continue until the current term of the Supreme Court expires, which is generally in late June, following which Jackson will be properly sworn in. Jackson worked as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer early in her career.
            
            Biden invited Jackson to the White House to watch the vote on television, and he shared a photo of the two beaming after the Senate acted on Twitter.</p>
        <p>All but three of the 115 persons who have served on the Supreme Court since its inception in 1789 have been white. Clarence Thomas, who was appointed in 1991 and is currently serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993, are the only two Black justices on the court. Sonia Sotomayor, the current Justice, is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>"I'm the father of a little Black child," Democrat Raphael Warnock, one of the Senate's three Black members, said during the discussion before the vote. I understand how much it meant to Judge Jackson to have overcome the twin whammy of racism and sexism to finally stand in the spotlight.... Judge Jackson's elevation to the Supreme Court exemplifies our democracy's promise of development. It's a fantastic day in America."</p>
